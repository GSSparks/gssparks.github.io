user @ garysparks.info ~> I'm a Linux and technology hobbyist, with around 15 years of home-lab experience and about 5 years of professional experience, turning a passion into a profession.

# Tech I Use:

### Linux:
Have installed, configured, and used a Linux server and desktop in production for my home-lab since the mid 2000s. Have used Linux desktop (currently KDE Plasma) as a “Daily Driver” since 2010. I use Arch BTW... ;)

### LAMP:
Successfully installed, configured, and deployed a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on an Arch server for a Wordpress website. Created SSL encryption using Letsencrypt. Have since then replaced Apache with Nginx. So, perhaps, my LAMP has become a LiNMP. #dad-joke

Successfully installed, configured, and deployed into production Nextcloud, Vaultwarden (Bitwarden), Collabora, and Jellyfin servers for my household and personal use.

### Docker:
Migrated native installations of these services to containers by learning and using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Networking:
Secured my home network with Open Source software by utilizing OpenWRT on a Netgear Router and separating the LAN into different zones. Further secured LAN by installing an instance of Pi-Hole to use as an ad blocker and DNS/DHCP server.

### Scripting:
Created a BASH script using Systemd timers and Pi-Hole to block and unblock certain MAC/IP addresses from accessing the internet at certain times. You can read about it here.

Created a Backup solution for my home-lab server by using Rsync, Systemd timers, and BASH.

### VPN:
Created a VPN, using Tailscale, to use when outside of the home LAN.

## Programming Projects:

### archive-dl:
An archive.org downloader written in python.

### thumbnail:
A thumbnail maker using BASH and ffmpeg.

### home-backup:
A BASH script that will backup your home folders in compressed tarballs if changes are detected.
